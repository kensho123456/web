<h5 style="text-decoration: red wavy underline;">ABOUT THIS DISCLAIMER AND WHAT IT MEANS...AND WHAT I MAY REQUIRE OF YOU</h5>
<blockquote><strong><span style="text-decoration: black wavy underline;">Proof of Authority</span></strong> &mdash; Can you demonstrate proof of authority of the kind required in a court of law.<!-- span<span>&nbsp;</span><a target="_blank" href="http://troonite.co.uk/z9/jscrypt.html"><span style="background:yellow;color:#999">Encryption/Decryption Tool </span></a><sup> (Opens a New Window)</sup -->
</blockquote>
<p>Could you provide <strong>foundation evidence</strong> that:&mdash;
<ul><li> there is someone with a higher claim on me than me;</li>
<li> copy  of an alleged contract where I have granted anyone authority over me;</li>
<li> a witness with a higher claim against me than me;</li>
<li> witness evidence (in any form) to demonstrate that someone has a higher claim on me than me.</li>
</ul></p>
 <p>Without consent from me no one has authority over me.  Acting as if this were so, does not constitute evidence of your authority over me: this is force not authority.  The only one able to lawfully grant you authority over me is me.   I DO NOT CONSENT to be forced, ruled, governed or policed UNLESS  I HAVE  SIGHT OF  PROOF OF AUTHORITY OVER ME, I believe no such authority exists.  However, if I commit a crime of HARM or LOSS against any other man or woman (or child)  they DO have lawful claim and authority to prosecute me.  Then there would be PROOF OF CLAIM (I have harmed them in some way).  There is PROOF OF AUTHORITY (They have a RIGHT to JUSTICE) and I  ought to put right  what I have done wrong.</p><p>I shall always be held to account for a CORPUS DELECTI (body of crime) CRIME:  meaning a crime must have been proven before I can be convicted of committing that crime but...I shall always be innocent (not 'not guilty') for any alleged crimes/offences that do not have PROOF of CLAIM or AUTHORITY (or loss)</p>
